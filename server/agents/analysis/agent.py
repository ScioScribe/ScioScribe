Analysis Agent using LangGraph - Specialized Visualization Agent System

This module implements a LangGraph-based visualization agent that processes
experiment plans and datasets to generate analytical visualizations using
specialized AI agents following Crew AI principles.

The agent orchestrates a 6-node pipeline of specialized experts:
1. Input Validation Specialist - Expert data validator and quality controller
2. Experiment Plan Analyst - Research methodology and plan interpretation expert
3. Data Profiling Specialist - Statistical analysis and data characterization expert
4. Visualization Strategy Expert - Chart selection and design methodology specialist
5. Code Generation Specialist - Plotly visualization code generation expert
6. Scientific Communication Expert - Explanatory text and memory management specialist

Each agent has a specific role, expertise domain, and clear objectives to ensure
high-quality, contextually appropriate visualizations for scientific analysis.
